# Google-landing-page-with-pure-HTML-CSS

This repository is just a display of the regular google search homepage, all stylings are in pure css, in case you feel like contributing it can be run on local sever by hitting "live edit" or "ctr + l" if you're using vscode and have installed the extension for editing live, else it can be opened directly in the browser.
